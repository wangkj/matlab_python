Decide whether the following statements are true (check the box) or false (leave it empty)
Select one or more:
a. If a full band signal is downsampled by a factor N, N-1 aliasing components appear before removing the zeros between samples. After removing the zeros the normalize frequency response is scaled by a factor N, stretching its spectrum. To perfectly recover the original band-passed signal without any aliasing components, it is only needed to insert N zeros between each sample.
b. The band-pass Nyquist method allows us to reconstruct a band-pass signal in a filter bank, if we sample with twice the rate as the bandwidth of such signal assuming ideal analysis and synthesis filters.
c. If a pi/N band-pass signal is downsampled by a factor N, N-1 aliasing components appear before removing the zeros between samples. After removing the zeros the normalize frequency response is scaled by a factor N, stretching its spectrum. To perfectly recover the original band-pass signal without any aliasing components, it is only needed to insert N zeros between each sample.
